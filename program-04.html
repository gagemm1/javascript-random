<p class="paragraph">The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it "the Riddle house," even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there.</p>
<p class="paragraph">It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building of miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was "creepy."</p>
<p class="paragraph">Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics of gossip were scarce.</p>
